    /**
     * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of
     * placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
     * Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
     * <p>
     * Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * <p>
     * Input: 4
     * Output: [
     * [".Q..",  // Solution 1
     * "...Q",
     * "Q...",
     * "..Q."],
     * <p>
     * ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
     * "Q...",
     * "...Q",
     * ".Q.."]
     * ]
     * Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
